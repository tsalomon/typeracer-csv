# Typeracer CSV

Typeracer requires you to have a paid account for you to export your data into a CSV format. 
This is a (hacky) workaround to export your race data into a CSV format through web scraping.

## Requirements
 - datetime
 - pandas
 - selenium (with a webdrivers executable in your PATH)
